## Making Change in Python

    Making change is a common problem in computer science and programming. It involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change. In Python, there are various approaches to solve this problem efficiently.

    One popular approach is to use dynamic programming. This involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively. By keeping track of the minimum number of coins needed for each subproblem, we can gradually build up the solution for the original problem. This approach is efficient and can handle larger amounts of change.

    Another approach is to use a greedy algorithm. This involves selecting the largest denomination of coins possible at each step until the desired amount of change is reached. While this approach may not always yield the optimal solution, it can be faster and simpler to implement.

    In conclusion, making change in Python can be approached using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm. Both approaches have their advantages and can be used depending on the specific requirements of the problem. By understanding these techniques, programmers can efficiently solve the making change problem in Python.
